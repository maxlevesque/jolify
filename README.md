HowTo
=====

Jolify is written in Perl. I am a beginner in Perl, but it seemed to be the most powerfull scripting language for my needs in Jolify.

You will need to install File::Slurp, a pluggin for Perl that simplifies life for opening and writing files.
In Fedora:
    sudo yum install perl-File-Slurp.noarch
